# Webshop

## Description
Simple food webshop that I made for school assignment. Originally it was only frontend but I updated it with Node.js for backend. Clicking on a category name lists all of the available items for that category. Hovering over one item shows a cart icon for adding it to your cart. App uses express-session for sessions so each users has their own cart. Since there is no login and user functionality, to actually see the sessions in work, open the app in 2 different browsers and play with adding/removing items to/from cart. On smaller screens app has a different layout. 
## Instalation
Download the repository, unzip the folder and open it in any code editor. In terminal, position yourself in project folder and run `npm install`. Finally, run `node server.js` and in any browser type `localhost:3000`.
